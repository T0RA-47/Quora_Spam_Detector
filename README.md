## 🧠 Model Details

* **Model:** LSTM-based classifier
* **Pre-trained GloVe embeddings:** 100D word vectors
* **Accuracy on validation:** **95.87%**

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔧 Installation

To install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### ▶️ Running the Notebook

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `notebook/Quora_Spam_Model_.ipynb`.
2. Run all the cells to train the model.

   * Ensure that the `train.csv` and `glove.6B.100d.txt` files are placed in the `/data` folder if re-running the model.
3. After training, save the model to `/model/quora_spam_model.h5`.

### 📥 Using the Trained Model

You can load the trained model with Keras:

```python
from keras.models import load_model

model = load_model('model/quora_spam_model.h5')
```
